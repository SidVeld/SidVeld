## Something more?

If you need to know something, see what is written below. If that's not enough, ask in person. I will be happy to answer!

### Languages

I am currently learning the following programming languages:

* Python
* C++
* DM
* JavaScript

### Tools and other stuff

To work with the code I most often try to use Visual Studio Code, but in some cases I use something else.

| Python             | C++                | DM                 | JavaScript         |
| :----------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| Visual Studio Code | Visual Studio code | Visual Studio code | Visual Studio code |
| Pycharm            | Visual Studio 2019 |                    |                    |
